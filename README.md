# Google Workspace PerfexCRM Module

This repository relies on Composer for dependency management. After cloning the project, run:

```bash
composer install
```

Running this command downloads the required packages and creates the `vendor/` directory in the repository root. The application and modules expect this location when loading Composer dependencies.
